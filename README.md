# JCdict - JSON formatter

This is a tool similar to [yomichan-import](https://github.com/FooSoft/yomichan), which turns dictionaries to the JSON format so as to be imported to [yomichan](https://github.com/FooSoft/yomichan).\
The tool is built for Chinese users, specifically the part-of-speech will be shown in Chinese (e.g. 名词 instead of noun)

Currently only support conversion from .txt of XiaoXueTang-JC

Todo
- integrate with Edict to support part-of-speech in zh
- support for zh-daijirin and zh-daijisen
